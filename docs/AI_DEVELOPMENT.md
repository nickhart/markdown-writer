# AI Development Transparency

This project was developed with assistance from AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality.

## Tools Used

- **Claude Code** (claude.ai/code): Interactive development environment for code generation, debugging, and documentation
- **Claude** (claude.ai): Planning, architecture discussions, and documentation review

## AI Assistance Areas

The AI tools provided assistance in:

- **Code Generation**: Bash scripting, function implementation, and error handling
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation, README updates, and code comments
- **Architecture**: System design decisions and code organization
- **Testing**: Test case identification and validation approaches
- **Debugging**: Error diagnosis and resolution strategies

## Human Oversight

All AI-generated code and documentation has been:

- Reviewed and tested by human developers
- Customized for specific project requirements
- Validated for security and functionality
- Integrated following established coding standards

## Transparency Commitment

This disclosure is provided in the interest of transparency about the development process. The use of AI tools was intended to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality and thorough documentation.
